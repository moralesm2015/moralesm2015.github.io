  <h2>Phoebus is the roman god or equivalent to Apollo in greek mythology. As such he is also the God of Archory, the Sun, Music, and Prophecy. Phoebus means ray. 
    In roman mythology he is said to ride a golden chairiot across the skies every morning for sunrise and every night for sunset. Phoebus is also the son of Zeus (God of the Skies and Gods) 
    and Leto (Goddess of the Moon). Zues is married to Hera (Goddess of Marriage) and in a fit of rage Hera banned Leto from giving birth on any peice of earth. 
    However, she forgot Delos and there is where Leto gave birth to Diana and Phoebus.<h2>
    <h1> The Story of Phaeton </h1>
    <h2> Phoebus had a son named Phaeton who was mortal. Phaeton was proud that he descended from a god and told anyone who would listen. However, when he would 
      make this claim everyone would say it was a lie and he should prove these claims. Phaeton met with Phoebus to ask and plead for the truth of whether or not 
      Phaeton was his son. Phoebus said "Of course it is true. To prove this to you I shall swear on the River Styx to do any one thing you ask of me." Swearing 
      on the River Styx was a serious oath to commmit to for a god. Phaeton wanted to drive the chariot that Phoebus rode across the sky every day. Phoebus had 
      pleaded and begged Phaeton to reconsider. Phaeton would not budge with his wish. Phoebus had to honor it as he swore on the River Styx. He saw how excited and 
      happy the wish had made Phaeton. However, he knew as he saw the happiness on his face it would be the last he would see his son. Phoebus knew how hard it was 
      to control the reins with the strength of a god. He knew Phaeton had no chance of survival, but was still forced to honor the oath. On the way up the sky Phaeton
      had moved to the center of the chariot and lost control of the reins and the horses had gone wild. The choas had knocked Phaeton out of the chariot and he 
      had passed before ever touching the ground.
